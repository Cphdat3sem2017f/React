## Resources: 

There are tons of ES6  and React articles on the Web. These are just a few of your recomendations

#### Our recommended resources for this week:

- The main resource is [reactjs.org]( https://reactjs.org/). Don't focus on the tutorial (it's absolutely not for beginners), but on the [Docs]( https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html). This is the real tutorial.
- We recommend (very much) that you watch, and code along this [Video Tutorial]( https://egghead.io/lessons/react-react-fundamentals-development-environment-setup). You should have completed the video before Friday
- If you like books, this [free book]( https://leanpub.com/the-road-to-learn-react) is recommended
