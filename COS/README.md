# Single Page Applications, React and ES6

## Plan

Before Day-1, complete the tasks given in message on moodle

---
For this period you can use whatever **IDE/editor** you like. If you prefer the same editor as the one i'm using during demo's you should:
* [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Visual Studio Code(vs-code) 
* [Read](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript) this document about vs-code, and install (my recommendations) the following extensions before the lesson: 
 *Debugger for Chrome, EsLint, Babel ES6/ES7, Path IntelliSense, npm Intellisense, vscode-icons*
* If you like videos, watch a few of [these](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/overview) (you might wanna come back later):
