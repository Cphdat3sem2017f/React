# Car app with CRUD

**Adding CRUD to the "car" application**

This exercise builds on the previous exercise where we created a [used car application](UsedCarsEx1.md). Now we will expand it to support all the four CRUD operations as sketched below.

See a live version of this exercise [Here](http://defective-pizzas.surge.sh/)

This exercise continue as a client only exercise, but part 4 of this exercise will add a backend. Part 3 will be about routing.

The UI above could have shown the form in a separate view for the "new cars"stuff . When we introduce routing, you will see that this is an "easy" thing to do.

Use the start code from [here](https://github.com/Thomas-Hartmann/usedcars), even if you completed the exercise yesterday. This code changes things a little bit, for example each car is provided with a unique id, and the JavaScript code is placed in separate files.

In the github repo read the README.md file

Implement the 3 methods that are not implemented to make the application work.

If you are a '**red**' student you should probably use the starter code for reference, but build the components your selves.
