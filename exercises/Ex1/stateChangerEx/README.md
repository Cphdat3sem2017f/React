This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
This project is create by THA <tha@cphbusiness.dk> to show case small example demos illustrated by use of components.
Each component is a separate demo and only a few of them has relationships.
The Index.js file is where one or another of these components are loaded and tested. To test a componet just put it in the DOM.render() method.
